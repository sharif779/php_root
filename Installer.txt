# php_root
Execute root commands via PHP.

To run the script as root no matter what user that executes it, we will need a binary wrapper. Here is wrapper.c

Compile and set proper permissions, including the suid bit (saying that it should run with root privileges):

# gcc wrapper.c -o php_root     # php_root can be dynamic
# chown root php_root
# chmod u=rwx,go=xr,+s php_root

php_root will now run with root permissions, and execute the commands specified

just run  the php_root file as ===./php_root '.$cmd'
